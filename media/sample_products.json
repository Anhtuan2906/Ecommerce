So how do you know which tape is right for you?There are a number of factors to  consider when choosing the right packaging tape:Note theweightof your package. The heavier the  package, the thicker the tape should be.Consider how the package is going to beshipped. If the package is travelling a long distance,  or will be handled by many people, choose one with higher tensile strength and  percent elongation, so the box stays closed even if dropped.Examine your shippingcontainer. While general  use tapes work well on popular single wall corrugated cardboard containers and  regular slotted containers (RSC), more and more cardboard boxes have higher  recycled content. This recycled corrugate content, as well as corrugate with  double or triple walls, needs a tape with an adhesive designed specifically for  this recycled content. Further, it needs a high adhesion to ensure the box  sticks securely and stays sealed throughout the shipping chain.About 3M&#x2122; Industrial Adhesives and TapesFor more than a century, 3M has applied innovation and  technology to improving our customers&rsquo; lives and supporting their business  goals.

With Ivation's magic-wand-like handheld scanner, you can easily scan and record photos, documents, articles, newspaper clippings, book excerpts, receipts and virtually anything else printed on paper or presented on screen. The PS4300 can operate on batteries independently and store recorded data on a micro-SD card. Alternatively, you can connect the scanner to your computer using a standard USB cable and scan directly onto the computer. It is even compatible with iPad and Android tablets - simply establish a USB connection (iPad may need adapter) to copy scanned images from scanner to tablet.Included in the box is: PS4300 900 DPI (dots per inch) portable scanner, MagicScan direct plugin (no drivers necessary) software CD, user manual, USB cable, and a handy pouch. Three included AAA alkaline batteries power the device when not used with computer, and last up to approximately 300 full-page scans. Scanning speeds vary depending on DPI settings: a 900 DPI scan in color takes about 9 seconds, while a monochromatic scan takes about 8 seconds. At 600 DPI, a color scan takes 4 seconds, and a monochromatic one just 2 seconds. Switch the sensor to 300 DPI for 2-second color scans and a quick 1- second mono scan.The included MagicScan software features full-fledged optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities. With picture direct scanning, scanned images are inserted directly into your software of choice (e.g. Microsoft Office, MSN, Skype). Supported file formats include JPEG and PDF, and the micro-SD card slot can handle cards up to 32GB in size. A status LCD display lets you know battery life and scanning information among other things, and the device has an auto-off feature that powers it down after 3 minutes of inactivity.",

Designed with each element of the HP printing process in mind, HP papers, toners, and inks are specially engineered to work together to deliver quality, reliable printing, as well as fade resistance, bolder blacks and more vibrant colors.Because HP papers are specifically formulated to work with HP printers, it's important to select the right HP paper for every job to ensure a crisp, clean finished product.Key HP Paper FeaturesCheck the label on HP paper packaging to find this key information:FinishConsider the look you want to achieve, and choose a finish that fits your needs:Glossy:For color images that really pop, try printing on a paper with a glossy finish.Matte:If printing a document with text, such as a term paper or resume, a matte finish can make your text easier to read.Satin:A satin finish will give your photos a smooth, professional touch.BrightnessThe brightness of your paper refers to the amount of light reflected from the surface of the paper, and is typically measured on a scale from 1 to 100. Print on brighter paper, such as HP Bright White Inkjet Paper, for higher contrast, crisper text, and a clean background for more vivid images.WeightThickness (measured in millimeters) and weight (measured in pounds), refer to the sturdiness and crease-resistance of your paper. HP paper comes in a variety of different weights.You may try using a heavier paper for artwork or pieces that will be frequently handled, like cards or brochures. Heavier paper can also help formal, more substantial printed pieces, such as resumes and invitations, stand out from the crowd.SizeHP offers many kinds of paper in a variety of sizes, from standard 8.5\" x 11\" paper, to 4\" x 6\" and 5\" x 7\" photo paper, to specialty sizes such as wide format and legal paper.Not all printers can handle all kinds of paper, so before stocking up, check your printer manual for paper size and weight capabilities.Choose Paper Suited To Specific TasksWhether printing driving directions, invoices, snapshots for the fridge, or formal wedding invitations, HP has the paper you need to get the job done.Multipurpose PrintingFor basic home and office printing, a simple, multipurpose paper is your best bet. Many HP multipurpose papers now feature ColorLok technology for more vibrant colors, bolder blacks, and fewer smears. Engineered with special additives that chemically react with inkjet inks, ColorLok paper absorbs ink deeper into the paper while holding the pigment closer to the surface, delivering impeccable print quality every time.HP Multipurpose Paper for Injet PrintersBright finish and smooth surface for sharp, professional-looking results.ColorLok technologyUsage Ideas: General office documents including copies and faxesHP Bright White Inkjet PaperBright, blue-white finish for sharper contrast and more vibrant colorColorLok technologyUsage Ideas: Proposals, presentations and newslettersHP LaserJet PaperBright finishThicker than standard paperHigh opacity prevents show-throughUsage Ideas: General office documents, especially documents that combine text with spot colors.Photo PrintingWhen you print on HP photo paper, you get professional, lab-quality photo prints every time.

        "description": "The Post-it&reg;Note was invented as a solution without a problem. In 1968 Dr. Spencer Silver, a 3M scientist, developed a unique, repositionable adhesive.

The rest is history.Today, Post-it&reg;boasts more than 4,000 unique products and has become one of the most well-known and beloved brands in the world.Are All Post-it&reg;Paper Products Recyclable?Yes. 3M has conducted recycling trials on Post-it&reg;Notes at recycled paper mills. The adhesive does not interfere with paper recycling, because the adhesive is substantially removed in the paper de-inking process.

Use them to color-code and date folders that hold important, time-sensitive documents, or simply re-organize a messy office refrigerator by labeling everyone's look-alike plastic container. These markers also come in handy for initializing kids' jackets and backpacks before they head off to school. And they're ideal for creating labels for plastic bins that hold toys, tools, or seasonal clothing.About SharpieDeveloped by the Sanford Ink Company, which was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1857 by Frederick W. Redington and William H. Sanford, Jr., the Sharpie Fine Point marker hit the market in 1964. It quickly became known as the first pen-style permanent marker that could write on almost any surface--from glass, wood and stone, to plastic, metal and, of course, paper. Endorsed by celebrities like NBC talk show hosts Johnny Carson and Jack Parr, the Sharpie marker quickly gained prominence.In the late nineties and early 2000s, the company introduced Sharpie markers in a variety of new, fun colors, including aqua, berry, turquoise and lime. By the end of 2002, over 200 million Sharpie markers had been produced, enough for approximately two Sharpie markers for every household in America!",

This replacement toner cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

Scan bills, receipts, reports and more. It&rsquo;s the perfect way to easily save electronic files of all your everyday documents.Text Enhancement with Auto Area Segmentation (AAS)Through this feature, text document scans are sharpened, thereby enhancing text recognition. In addition, all background data is removed from the scan, making it easier than ever to achieve clear scans from double&ndash;sided documents that have &quot;bleed&ndash;through&quot; from images or text printed on the reverse side. Auto Area Segmentation is a function that allows the scanner to segment a scanned document, identifying all text as &quot;text areas&quot; and all images as &quot;image areas&quot;. Text areas are scanned in black&ndash;and&ndash;white, while image areas are scanned in half&ndash;tone. This offers the best scanning mode for all elements, and ensures that all text and image data is preserved simultaneously.Color EnhanceWith Color Enhance, users can select and enhance a color from the RGB color channel, even when scanning in black&ndash;and&ndash;white. This can help bring out a particular element that might not otherwise show up clearly in a black&ndash;and&ndash;white scan, such as a signature made with a light&ndash;blue pen.Color DropoutColor Dropout allows users to remove a color from the RGB color channel &mdash; a color that might cause noise or other image issues during a document scan. For example, a user scanning an invoice printed on pink paper could use &quot;Color Dropout: Red&quot; to ignore all red elements and pull out the crisp black text.Event ManagerEpson Event Manager allows you to configure jobs so they can be initiated with one touch, making the Epson Perfection V500 Office easy and convenient.

Though it takes a little effort to master the collection of financial worksheets available on the Texas Instruments BA II Plus, you'll be glad you invested the time and money in this fine financial calculator.The BA II Plus operates in standard calculator and worksheet modes. The standard mode lets you perform common math as well as operations involving the time value of money--that is, applications such as mortgages or annuities in which payments are equal and evenly spaced. You can also perform trigonometric functions in standard mode.The more hard-core worksheet mode includes tables for amortization, bond, depreciation, and compound interest. If you're not familiar with such calculations, the very helpful user's manual will guide you through the process. All previous worksheet values are stored in memory, so you don't have to retype all the bond maturity or cash flow analysis figures.The average user who wants to calculate a basic loan payment will be more comfortable working in the standard calculator mode. We were using the BA II Plus tools for calculating basic interest and payment periods within minutes. Still, it's good to know that the more advanced features are available for those who require heavy-duty financial computing.Finance students and average users alike will find much to like in the Texas Instruments BA II Plus.--John Frederick Moore",

        "description": "Buying an all-in-one unit designed to be partnered with your Mac may be the perfect solution for your family or small business, rather than stocking a roomful of electronics. Canon's MultiPass C545 is an ink-jet-based multifunction unit with the key features of color printing, scanning, and copying that are designed to work together and are supplemented by a fax function. The black text in crisp 720 x 360 dpi brings a professional look to r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, papers, and presentations at 5 ppm. Color prints at 2 ppm. You can print on all the papers you'd expect from a high-quality unit, including letter and legal papers, envelopes, glossy photo, gloss film, and transparencies. A one-touch button makes scanning and editing photos for all kinds of projects and e-mail easy, even for the novice. A flatbed scanner lets you scan books and magazines. You'll appreciate OCR software for scanning text, and the clear optical resolution of 600 x 600 dpi with 24-bit depth provides accurate color.Use the color copy features of the C545 without starting up your computer. One button supplies posters, mirror images, and superzoom. Save time running around town to pickup photo reprints and enlargements when you can print your own on photo paper. The copier feature reproduces in 360 x 360 dpi resolution, for black and color, with reduction capability up to 70 percent. Load paper in the rear of unit and collect finished work on your desktop. A low-ink sensor alerts you to get more, and the separate black and tricolor ink tanks mount in a removable print head. Transmit faxes with another one-touch feature, automatically speed dialing to send up to 30 pages at 6 seconds per page (14,400 bps), or print incoming faxes at 4 ppm.The MultiPass C545 offers family-friendly features and software. Children and adults alike will express themselves more creatively in home projects, school assignments, work, and community projects. And don't forget the advantages of an all-in-one unit with a small footprint of 14.4 by 12.7 by 8.1 inches and just 10.5 pounds for saving space, and reducing clutter and the need for disparate accessories and supplies. The software bundle includes the MultiPass CD-ROM for Mac with printer drivers and multifunction setup utilities, plus Canon Photo, TextBridge Pro, OfficeReady CC, ChromaFax, Printmaster SE, and EarthLink Sprint Total Access. The box includes a power adapter, phone cord, color and black ink cartridges, and an ink cartridge container. The unit is covered by a limited one-year warranty.--Barbara Price",

        "description": "Premium, Professional QualityPaper thin cards with jagged, perforated edges? Just because you print your cards yourself doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to look homemade! Avery&rsquo;s unique, patented Clean Edge&reg; technology enables these business cards to snap apart from the sheet, leaving completely smooth, non-perforated edges... just like professionally printed cards. Plus, they are made from thick, stiff cardstock, so they are durable and also feel like premium cards.&nbsp; And you can print vivid color graphics and sharp text on both sides.Free, Easy to Use TemplatesAvery&rsquo;s Design &amp; Print Online tool (www.avery.com/print) contains thousands of free pre-designed templates that are easy to customize. It&rsquo;s completely Internet-based, so there is no software to download and is compatible with both PC and Mac&reg; operating systems. You can easily import your own images, graphics or logos, and can save your projects on your computer for easy editing and reprinting.Why Should I Print My Own Business Cards?&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Minimum Order Quantities.&nbsp; Print as many or as few cards as you need, when you need them.&nbsp; So, if you only need 20 cards, then just print 20 cards (instead of having to order 500 from a printer).&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customizable.&nbsp; Because you can print as few as 10 cards at a time, you can change your business cards as often you&rsquo;d like.&nbsp; For example, you might want to feature a &ldquo;product of the month&rdquo; on the back of your card.&nbsp; Or maybe you want to promote upcoming events or advertise time sensitive promotions.&nbsp; And how often have you had to throw away a box of business cards because your phone # or e-mail address changed or you were given a new title?&nbsp; What a waste!&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available Right Away.&nbsp; Uh oh... you just realized you ran out of business cards as you&rsquo;re packing for a business trip or preparing for a big meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; Not to worry.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to wait days or weeks for a printer to print and ship your cards or pay a huge fee for expedited shipping.&nbsp; Just print off a few sheets of business cards and your problem is solved in minutes.&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordable.&nbsp; In most cases, if you need less than 500 cards at a time, it&rsquo;s cheaper to print your own cards than to order them online or from a printer&sup1;.&nbsp; Online printers may lure you in with an attractive offer, but then they often charge extra fees for backside printing, color printing, uploading your logo, proofing, better cardstock, different colors, textures or finishes, etc.&nbsp; Do the math--figure out the cost per card after all these fees are added.&nbsp; Then compare to Avery&rsquo;s Clean Edge&reg; Business Cards, which cost only about 8 cents per card1 and Avery&rsquo;s on-line design tool with thousands of pre-designed templates is FREE!Great Ways to Use Avery Clean Edge&reg; Business CardsAvery Clean Edge&reg; Business Cards are printable on both sides, so be sure to take advantage of the back side of the card.Promotional Tool for Small BusinessesGrow your business by using your business card as a promotional tool.
